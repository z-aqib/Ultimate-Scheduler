# Ultimate Scheduler   
Welcome to Zuha's Ultimate Timetable Scheduler!    

Studying at university, out of all the stressful things i endured, the biggest "problem" of our lives was and is and will remain, **enrollment**. Getting a good timetable, with *lenient* teachers is all we want - but every semester, at enrollment time, more than half of the univeristy camps out outside the Program Office.     

Not to mention each university has multiple batches of each undergraduate program, and multiple departments.     

... and what they do is, is give you one excel sheet with all the classes. of all programs and all departments and all batches.    

Not cool.    

Its especially not cool when you have to 
- traverse through the entire excel sheet using the "FIND" option and find all the courses being offered for your batch and your program. 
- And then you spend hours just brainstorming timetables that can be made from those courses. 
- And then at the time of enrollment you dont get course(s) and you panic trying to find another timetable which could work.    

(sorry for the reality check)     

### Thats when I came in.    

This web application takes your excel sheet, reads it, extracts all the courses that your program-batch is offered, and creates all the possible timetables - **in a matter of seconds**.   
- It is real time updated, meaning if the excel sheet is updated, you can re-enter your sheet and re-generate them.   
- It also provides you a list of all the courses it used to make the timetable, including class numbers, class locations and instructor names.  

### Cool right?   

But it gets better - this isnt only for students, but for the **program office as well**. When sending out the timetable, the Program Office endures many complains that students cannot make timetables because their courses are clashing. This instantly solves the problem - the Program Office can quickly generate timetables for each batch and check which course is missing and which needs to be rescheduled.
